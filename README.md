# seaTurtleGame

This game consists of a turtle who moves in all directions using the mouse. The goal of the game is to drive the turtle on top of every bubble and click on
it.  One point will be added to the score every time a bubble is clicked.  There is a timer on the upper left hand corner, if you can make a score greater
than 9 when the timer is still at 10 seconds on above, an additional 10 more seconds will be added.  The bubbles appear randomly on the screen, one at a time, and disappear when they are clicked.
